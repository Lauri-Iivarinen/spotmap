## Problem
Parkour is fast growing extreme sport which requires ultimate body control, decision making and endurance. While parkour can be practised in indoor gyms the real *rush* comes while training outside.
Training places can include (among others):
  - Fallen tree in woods
  - Slant wall under a bridge
  - Staircases and blocks caused by elevation in cities
  - A bench in the park

Finding some of these training spots can be a difficult task and during my time practising there have developed some favorites, however not everyone knows these "favorites" therefore it will be difficult to share these great spots to other athletes.

## Solution
Spotmap app made with React Native, gives all parkour athletes the needed tools to save, share and find the best training spots near you. App uses location data from your own phone to act as a navigator to nearby spots. You can comment and like the spots you have enjoyed (or hated:3).
